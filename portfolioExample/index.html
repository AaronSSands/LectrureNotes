    <!-- What is Bootstrap? Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects. -->
    <!-- How do I use Bootstrap? Head to https://getbootstrap.com/ and click the 'Get Started' button. -->
    <!-- In the getting started guide, you should see CSS and JS, each with respective links under them. To access the Bootstrap framework, we need to use these links in our HTML file. Follow the directions on Bootstrap's website and copy/paste the necessary 'link' and 'script' tags. -->

      <!-- Projects -->
      <!-- Although we are not using a Bootstrap component for our projects section, 
        we are using Bootstrap's grid system to help with the layout of our webpage. 
        In the 'Grid' section located in the left sidebar, there is documentation explaining how 
        to implement Bootstrap's grid system within our webpage. -->
    <!-- Bootstap's grid system has 12 columns that span the horizontal width of our viewport. 
        By using the container, row, and col classes, we can use the grid system to evenely space 
        out how many columns we want. In our code below, we have three div's that are each taking 
        up 4 columns of the alloted 12 - which means they should be evenly spaced, taking up 4 
        columns each. -->
    <!-- Below we have a container, with a nested row, and 3 nested columns. The container is 
        simply just a container for our content that we want to display in our grid. The row will 
        align our columns in a horizontal row. And the columns are were we store our information.  -->
